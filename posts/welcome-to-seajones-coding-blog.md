# Welcome to the Seajones' coding blog

Welcome to this, my new Github Pages powered coding blog.  I'll be covering many aspects of web application coding on here, mainly frontend with some frontend-centric backend stuff in here too.

So that you're prepared for what I'll have on here, I work mainly in HTML5/CSS3/Javascript using SASS and SCSS, and my preferred language for friendly backend systems is Python/Django, using templating from Handlebars.

I'm dedicated to the paradigm of apps as an API, with the front and backend clearly seperate systems, and with client side apps accessing this, so this will be a big focus of the blog.  Also expect plenty of CSS and SASS tips.
